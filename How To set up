First you got to download Android Studio.
Then you got to go to learnroadrunner.com and click "Get Started", Then go all the way down and click "Installing".
Then you need to open Andriod studio and open a project and pick the Road Runner file and the code goes in the "org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode".
Well, Hope this helps.
